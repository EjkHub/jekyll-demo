to get the logo in the sidebar had to override site_nav.html this way

Copy the file into your project
# gem path on your machine (adjust drive/folder if different)
C:\Ruby34-x64\lib\ruby\gems\3.4.0\gems\just-the-docs-0.10.1\_includes\components\site_nav.html

Paste it into the matching place in your site:
your-site\
└─ _includes\
   └─ components\
      └─ site_nav.html   ← (now overrides the theme copy)

Insert the logo include
Open the copied _includes/components/site_nav.html.
Near the top you’ll see the main <nav> opening tag, e.g.
<nav aria-label="Main" id="site-nav" class="site-nav">
  {% include logo.html %} --Here--
   etc...

{% include … %} always starts its search at the project-level _includes/ folder, not at the location of the file that calls it. If you wanted to include a file that’s inside a sub-folder you would write, e.g., {% include components/foo.html %} – still relative to the root _includes/.
your-project/
├─ _includes/               ← include “root”
│   ├─ logo.html            ← Jekyll finds this
│   └─ components/
│       └─ site_nav.html    ← calls {% include logo.html %}
